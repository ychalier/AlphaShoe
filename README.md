## usage

I placed data file (.csv) in a `data/` folder at the root of the repository. CSV files are in .gitignore to avoid poluting the repository. The data folder contains the following files:

 - `customers.csv`
 - `products.csv`
 - `X_train.csv`
 - `X_test.csv`
 - `y_train.csv`

Then start Jupyter and open `base.ipynb` with a *Python 2* kernel.

The best score has been achieved on TPT servers using `deep.py`.
